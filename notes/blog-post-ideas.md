# Blog post ideas

I am learning lots of new things every day during GSoC! These are some of the random ideas that pop into my head on which I'll probably write some posts. 

## Technical

* An overview (deep-dive?) into the k8s codebase
* An introduction to bash
    - why I think (thought?) bash is beautiful
    - have a look at the deep dark bash forest in k8s
    - write why its so dark (and fun!)
* Lessons learnt while writing a design proposal
* Code generation in Go
* Git tricks I learnt while contributing
    - this can be an useful later on as well!
    - make it as comprehensive as possible
* Converting types in Go
* Documentation for the go-openapi library (or simple examples)
* Subtleties of JSON Schema
* OpenAPI spec's inconsistencies :/
* Adding new API types in kubernetes
* Adding sub-resources for new resources

## Meta

These can be a little technical too! :P

* How to contribute to kubernetes
    - major point: where to start?
    - how to keep at it after starting?
    - why are people intimidated? (explain self journey)
* My changed perception of code-reviews :)
    - why I was scared of them
    - why I like them now
    - mindset to have when you are getting a code review
    - mindset when you are giving the code review
* How to apply to GSoC
    - break this down into multiple posts
    - TODO: decide sub-topics for posts
* My experience logging my activities during GSoC
    - how it has been so helpful
    - what patterns can I see?
    - what do I learn from this?
* The Amazing Kubernetes Community
    - awesome experiences I have had until now
    - the wonderful friends I have made here :)
    - the awesome slack :)
