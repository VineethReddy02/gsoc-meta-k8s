Google Summer of Code has three periodic evaluations. The following are the evaluation notes from my mentor [Dr. Stefan Schimanski](https://github.com/sttts).

## First Evaluation

Awesome work so far!

I especially like the very active communication with me as the mentor, but more importantly in the community, i.e. in PRs, in issues and of course the design proposal. Never be shy to put forward your opinion and ideas on things and talk to other developers in other projects. OpenSource projects live from exactly this open communication and wouldn't work without. So, very well done so far!

It would be great see you passing on the new experience about how to get going in the project to other future contributors. Hint: next to the usual ways like blogs, tweets etc. there is KubeCon coming up in December, happening in Austin, CFP ending somewhen in August. Would be an awesome topic to describe your journey.

## Second Evaluation

Well done validation implementation! Should not be long until it's merged. Lot's of people are waiting for that feature.

Getting a complex API implemented, especially with non-standard types like embedded JSON is far from an easy task. It requires a lot of patience and determination to get all the small things fixed in the tooling around, generators, marshaling, openapi. So congrats to have mastered that!

## Third Evaluation

Congratulations for the merge of CRD validation into Kubernetes! That's huge! Building something that complicated, with all ups and downs during the proposal process and the endless comments and change requests during implementation (which is completely normal for these kind of changes and is the reason why some OpenSource projects actually succeed), and finally getting it to the tens of thousands of users in the next release, you can be really proud of having mastered this process. Being able to solve technical challenges is one thing, but for real success in OpenSource and of OpenSource the other skills of (i) getting things done and out to the users and (ii) being a good community member are at least as important, seeing all your contributions that had nothing to do with the actual task, be it helping out people in Slack or Github or fixing annoying bugs at the roadside. So, very very well done!

Last but not least the subresource proposal is also in the pipe and looks great. In three months time there will be the 1.9 around the corner. It would be awesome to see CRD subresources coming to life in that release as well. I think everybody in the community would love to keep you active in the project, me included of course. The last 3 months were a pleasure to work with you.

Finally, wherever your future will lead you, whether in Kubernetes or any other area, keep following your excitement for a topic, don't be afraid and have the trust in yourself to be able to make difference. You will.
